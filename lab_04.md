# Lab 0.4 - Getting to Know You
In this lab, you will explore SNAP and create a simple "self-portrait" program to introduce yourself to your instructors and classmates.

<tr>
 <td>
  <strong>Content - Programming language constructs to support input/output, logic, decision structure, and loops</strong></br><br>
The SNAP programming language provides you with a wide variety of programming “blocks” that can be assembled together to create some very cool programs.<br><br>
These blocks allow the computer programmer (you!) to perform some important programming tasks such as:<br>
 <ul>
  <li>Receive input from a user</li>
<li>Output information to a user</li>
<li>Perform math calculations or compare things</li>
<li>Make decisions based on data or input from the user</li>
  <li>Loop your programming code so that sections can be repeated a given number of times.</li>
 </ul>

## Part 1 - Exploring SNAP
1. Open [SNAP](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html) on your computer and spend a few minutes looking around, trying things out, and seeing what the language can do.  Don't worry about understanding everything completely-- we'll go through things in a lot more detail soon.  Just try to get a sense of some of the basic capabilities.

2. Write down three things you found that SNAP can do and how to do them.  Be as specific as you can!
 
 | SNAP can do this...| If I do this... |
 | --- | --- |
 | 1.  |     |
 | 2.  |     |
 | 3.  | .   |

3. Find a partner and compare notes.  Share your findings with your partner and ask him or her about what he or she learned.  Write down the three capabilities your partner found below.

 | SNAP can do this... | If I do this... |
 | --- | --- |
 | 1.  |     |
 | 2.  |     |
 | 3.  | .   |

## Part 2 - Who Are You?
4. Using what you've learned and other things you might discover, create a SNAP program that describes yourself.  This can take whatever form and use whatever SNAP tools and blocks you want.  Make sure that somehow, at some point in your program you show the following information:
    * Your name
    * Your current grade
    * Your age
    * Your favorite class in school
    * One of your hobbies or interests
    * Any previous programming or computer experience you have
    * Now that you have had some additional time to think about "I am ____", express who you are using SNAP.
