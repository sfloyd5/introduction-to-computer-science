# Lesson 1.2: Building Blocks

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

-   Name the categories of blocks in SNAP and describe what the blocks in each category do
-   Describe the function of several common SNAP blocks (see [lab](lab_12.md) for specific blocks)
-   Be able to use common blocks to build simple SNAP programs (see [lab](lab_12.md) for specific blocks)

## Materials/Preparation

-   [Do Now 1.2: Tracing and Debugging](do_now_12.md)  
-   [Lab 1.2](lab_12.md) handout (SNAP Scavenger Hunt) ([Download in Word](https://tealsk12.gitbooks.io/introduction-to-computer-science/content/Unit%201%20Word/Lab%201.2%20SNAP%20Scavenger%20Hunt.docx)) ([Link to PDF](https://tealsk12.gitbooks.io/introduction-to-computer-science/content/Unit%201%20PDF/Lab%201.2%20SNAP%20Scavenger%20Hunt.pdf))
-   Read through the handout so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students

## Instructor's Notes

#### Emphasize with students...

#### Content - Programming language constructs to support input/output, logic, decision structure, and loops

The SNAP programming language provides you with a wide variety of programming “blocks” that can be assembled together to create some very cool programs.

These blocks allow the computer programmer (you!) to perform some important programming tasks such as receiving input from the user, outputting information to a user, performing math calculations or comparing things, making decisions based on data or input from the user and looping programming code so that sections can be repeated a given number of times.

In SNAP these blocks are arranged in the Motion, Looks, Sound, Pen, Control, Sensing, Operators and Variables.

1.  Introductory discussion

    -   Review the basics of SNAP from the previous lesson
        -   Ensure that students can:
            -   Define "block" and "script"
            -   Describe how to build a script (snapping blocks together)
            -   Explain how scripts are executed (one block at a time in order)
    -   Introduce the concept of block categories
        -   Ask students to consider why categories are helpful as opposed to having a simple list of blocks

2.  Activity

    -   Individually or in pairs, have students work through the ["SNAP Scavenger Hunt"](lab_12.md) activity
        -   Students should turn in answers to all questions and SNAP programs for the final problems

3.  Debrief
    -   Go through each question or prompt in parts 1 and 2 and ask students to share their answer
        -   Cold calling works well for this lab due to the large number of questions
        -   Point out the color coding for each category
        -   Emphasize important details in some of the blocks listed in part 2, such as:
            -   the ![](think.png) block will leave the bubble on the stage until something else is thought
            -   the ![](gotox-y.png) and ![](glide.png) blocks require explicit x- and y-coordinates
        -   Solicit a few student responses for each category in part 2.2 before commenting yourself
            -   Try to guide the students to discuss with each other and settle on a description for each category with minimal instructor intervention
    -   Discuss one or two student solutions to each of the SNAP programming problems
        -   Either solicit volunteers or cold call
        -   Point out differences between student solutions and call attention to the fact that there is more than one way to solve a problem

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   Colorblind students may not be able to identify the block colors, but can still recognize the organization of categories. Be sensitive to this, but no modifications are likely required.
-   Students that are struggling with the lab can be paired up and/or receive individual instructor attention to help them through the activity.
-   The bonus assignment (3.4) should be used for students who finish quickly, and can be a setup for the [Animation Project](project_1.md).
