# Lesson 3.2: Procedures

## Student Objectives

Students will be able to...

-	Build custom command blocks in SNAP
-	Utilize detail removal and generalization to construct blocks that practice abstraction


## Materials/Preparation

## Instructor's Notes

#### Emphasize with students...

#### Big Ideas - Products can be designed for life cycle

There are many advantages to creating custom blocks in SNAP, but one of them is that they will allow you to reuse code. <br><br>
Imagine completing a program that uses a custom block to draw a smiley face. Anytime you require a smiley face in the program you can simply call the block of code. Later, you might work on a new project that requires a smiley face. If this is the case, you could easily reuse the block from your previous program.

This ability to easily reuse code, whether it be within one program, or within several programs, helps us understand the life cycle of products. It costs money to create and update programs. Anytime we can save money by speeding up the coding process means we can create a better product. It also means that as we create projects, we think further down the line about how this project might be maintained or altered later on. By using custom blocks of code, the maintenance and updates can be made easier.

#### Curricular Competencies – Applied Design - Understanding Context

As you allow for user input into the program, think carefully about the user and about they will interact with your program. What is the best way to prompt them for information? What is the best way for them to enter information? What is the best way to acknowledge their input, or to indicate they have inputted invalid data?

These questions need to be carefully considered as you design software for end users. Sometimes it’s a good idea to interview end users before designing the software. That way you learn about their needs and the way they use software. It might also be a good idea to do some initial testing with end users so that you can see how they interact with the program and they can provide feedback in order to improve the software.

1.	Lecture and Demonstration
	-	Review with students the concepts of abstraction, generalization, and detail removal
		-	Ask students to provide definitions and examples of each
	-	Discuss when abstraction can be used to help simplify code
		-	Guide students to realization that much code is used in many similar circumstances and shouldn’t be rewritten
		-	Emphasize potential for errors when changes are made in addition to inconvenience when code is redundant
	-	Demonstrate constructing a custom command block
		-	Use a simple example, such as jumping (from the platform game)
		-	If needed, use part 2.1 (drawing a square) as a further example
2.	Activity
	-	Students should complete the “Drawing Shapes (Again)” activity individually or in pairs
		-	Work with students to be certain that they are using custom blocks and variables as described by the activity
		-	Point out places where code can be abstracted and generalized
		-	Emphasize conciseness and clarity in code
3.	Review
	-	Discuss one or two student submissions
		-	Point out differences between different students’ solutions
		-	Point out missed opportunities for abstraction (if any)
		-	Discuss how this custom block can be useful

##BJC Lecture Suggestion
####Good for Classroom Instruction
 * [BJC Video Suggestion: BJC Lecture 4: Functions ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uKCBmQEf5w)
  - [MIT Scratch --> BYOB Snap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uKCBmQEf5w&t=10m0s)  (Development of SNAP, Demo) 10:00-11:30
  - [BYOB-Custom Blocks ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uKCBmQEf5w&t=10m0s)  (Explains functions with examples)   11:30-14:50


## Accommodation/Differentiation
-	In addition to attempting the bonus in the lab, advanced students can be encouraged to write a new custom block that draws a specified number of the given shape (for example, 2 squares or 5 hexagons).  The number of shapes should be taken as user input.
-	Struggling students can be given solution code for all of section 1.  Work with these students to answer the questions in part 1.5 so that they are prepared to attempt the custom block authoring.
