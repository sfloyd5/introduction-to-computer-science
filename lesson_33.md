## Instructor's Notes

1.  Lecture
    1.  Introduce block arguments
        -   Ask students to speculate on risks of relying on variables instead of arguments
            -   Variables could be changed by code other than the custom block, variable names could be changed causing errors, etc.
        -   Emphasize importance of custom blocks being self-contained
            -   Custom blocks should continue to function correctly independent of any other changes in the program
            -   Custom blocks should work correctly anywhere in the program and not require specific setup or cleanup
        -   Point out how frustrating code would be if blocks like ![](move.png) required setting a variable with a specific name to work
    2.  Demonstrate declaration and usage of arguments
        -   Point out that arguments are very similar to script variables, except their values come outside the block
        -   Explain argument types
            -   Only discuss text, numbers, and Booleans
                -   Other types can be mentioned, but won't be used in the course
            -   Ask students to describe why restricting types is important
        -   Point out that arguments are passed by value
            -   Specifically, changing the value of an argument inside a custom block will typically NOT change the value at the call site
        -   [Arguments example](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=brettwo&ProjectName=Lesson%203.3)
            -   Basic argument in pen category
            -   Pass by value example in "Variables" category
2.  Activity
    -   Students should complete the ["Let Me Check My Calendar"](lab_33.md) activity individually or in pairs
        -   This lab consists of a series of independent custom blocks.  The blocks need not necessarily be completed in the order given, but are roughly in order of difficulty.
        -   The bonus (part 3.4) requires implementing a fairly complex formula.
3.  Debrief
    -   Ask a different student to provide their solution to each part.  
    -   If time allows, discuss multiple solutions to each part.
        -   Emphasize differences and encourage discussion about advantages and disadvantages.
        -   Point out corner cases and cases where typed arguments are particularly helpful.
            -   For example, avoiding try to find out whether "bubblegum" is a leap year

#### Emphasize with students...

#### Big Ideas - Products can be designed for life cycle
    
Think carefully about how these custom blocks could be used in other programs, or how they could be used if you had to expand this current program. There are quite a lot of uses for custom blocks that format the days, months and years. A number of software applications might all require these types of custom blocks including calendar software, billing and payments software, alarms and notification software as well as recording of events and data software.

In addition, if any updates had to be made to existing programs then it would be much easier to make these updates if code is contained in custom blocks.

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   Part 3.4 is a fairly complex formula and should be a challenge for advanced students.
-   Struggling students should focus on section 1. The problems in section 2 represent more complex algorithms, but not necessarily any more difficult usage of arguments.
