# Lesson 4.4: List Practice II

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

-   Traverse a list, accessing each element one at a time
-   Perform operations combining all elements in a list
-   Select defined subsets of elements in a list

## Materials/Preparation

-   [Do Now 4.4: Traversing List ](do_now_44.md)

## Instructor's Notes

---

#### Emphasize with students...

#### Curricular Competencies - Testing
    
Testing is an important stage in design. So far, youâ€™ve probably tested your programs quickly by running them and inputting one or two different types of data. When designing large software applications, programmers create formal testing plans. They indicate different inputs and expected outputs, then they run the program with the input and keep track of the actual output. If the generated output is different than expected then they make changes to the program and log the changes in a test log.

For the program below, a test log has been created for you. When you are done each component of the program, test it using the indicated output.

-   Review
    -   Ask students to define "traversal" and outline the basic code pattern
        -   You need not write actual code here, but have students mention the key points (index variable, use index to access each item, repeat length of list, etc.)
    -   Review solutions to lab 4.3
        -   Ask a student to provide their solution to each part
        -   Discuss errors or flaws in each solution
        -   Point out similarities between each part, emphasizing that the basic code pattern is the same each time with only the operation performed on each item changing
            -   If you feel students can handle it, you can further classify various traversals (maps, filters, folds)
        -   If necessary, provide the basic code pattern for a traversal again:

            ![simple list traversal](simpleListTraversal.png)
-   Activity
    -   Students should complete the "Number Cruncher" lab individually
        -   The operations in this lab are fairly similar to those in lab 4.3, but work with lists of numbers instead of names.  As a result, students should progress more quickly.
        -   As in lab 4.3, help students realize that the basic code pattern in each part will be the same.
-   Debrief
    -   Ask one or two students to share their solution to each part of the lab
        -   If all students seem to grasp the concept, not all parts need to be reviewed
        -   If skipping some parts, be sure to review at least parts 1.1 (a fold), 2.1 (a map) and 2.2 (a filter)
    -   Point out that the solutions from labs 4.3 and 4.4 will look quite similar, even though in lab 4.3 the lists contained names in in lab 4.4 they contained numbers
        -   The traversal code pattern is the same regardless of the type of elements in the list

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   Advanced students should complete both bonus parts of the lab (1.5 and 2.3) and then assist struggling students.
-   Students who need more assistance should focus on parts 1.3, 2.1, and 2.2.  Ensure that all students are able to complete at least these three parts before concluding the lesson.
