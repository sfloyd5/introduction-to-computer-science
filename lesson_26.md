# Lesson 2.6: Combining Variables  

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

-   Combine loops with conditionals to create models with repeated but conditional behavior

## Instructor's Notes

#### Emphasize with students...

#### Content - Requirements of a problem statement

In this task there are specific requirements that need to be met in order for you to obtain full marks and complete the work. Pay close attention to these requirements.

It might be a good idea to print this page so that you can check off each of the requirements as they are met. This will ensure that you start organized and the you complete all requirements described in the problem.

1.  Review and lecture
    1.  Review loops and conditionals
        -   Ask students what loops do, when they are useful, and what loops exist in SNAP
            -   loops cause code to execute multiple times
            -   loops can help reduce redundancy and increase readability
            -   SNAP contains three loops: repeat, forever, and repeat until
        -   Ask students what conditionals are for and when they are useful
            -   conditionals are used to execute a block of code only under certain circumstances
        -   Encourage discussion about previous activities
        -   Fill in understanding gaps when necessary
    2.  Demonstrate combining loops and conditionals
        -   Present ![](<repeat until.png>) and ![](foreverIf.png)
        -   Ask students to suggest when these constructs might be useful
            -   "repeat until" is useful when a loop needs to run not for a set number of iterations, but until some situation occurs
            -   "forever if" is useful when code should execute _any time_ a condition is true, for the duration of the program
        -   Point out that the condition in "repeat until" is a termination condition, while in "forever-if" it is a continuation condition
    3.  Introduce the concept of modeling
        -   _modeling: building a system to simulate the behavior of a real-life phenomenon by simplifying or ignoring certain details_
        -   Ask students to suggest systems or concepts that might need to be modeled
        -   Discuss important considerations when designing and implementing a model
            -   Lead students to realize that most sacrifice some amount of accuracy or realism for simplicity
2.  Activity
    -   Students should complete "What Goes Up..." lab individually
        -   Mention that the code written in this lab will be helpful for the Platform Game project
3.  Debrief

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   Take care to ensure that all students have functional code by the end of the lab to avoid putting some students at a disadvantage starting the project
    -   If many students struggle, consider releasing your own solution after the lab has been completed in class
    -   Utilize TAs and advanced students to assist struggling studentsâ€”it is vital that all students complete this lab in advance of starting the project
-   Advanced students can consider increasing the realism of their gravity model by adding acceleration and/or beginning to implement jumping
