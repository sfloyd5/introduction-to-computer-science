## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

-   Create static lists in SNAP
-   Access elements of a list
-   Add and remove elements from a list

## Instructor's Notes

---

#### Emphasize with students...

#### Content - Programming language constructs to support input/output, logic, decision structure, and loops

This program involves quite a bit of organization and computer programming knowledge. You are probably combining user input, variables, random numbers, decision structures, loops and screen output.

These programming language constructs include the knowledge and skills needed to get programs to run. Itâ€™s amazing how they can be used to create such different programs. This program generates sentences, but using the same constructs you could create mathematics software, or video games, or scheduling software. When it comes to applying these constructs to create cool programs, the possibilities are endless!

---

-   Lecture
    -   Review the concept of a list from the previous lesson
        -   Ask students to brainstorm examples of when lists could be useful
            -   To store an unknown number of values (e.g. a bunch of student test scores)
            -   To store a collection of related values as one entity (e.g. the number of absent students each day over a week)
    -   Demonstrate creating lists in SNAP
        -   Use the variadic (taking a variable number of arguments) "list" block to create a simple list
        -   Point out the format in which lists are displayed (gray box with red elements)
        -   Show that lists can be assigned to variables like other values
            -   Emphasize that the list is considered a single value, even though it consists of multiple values
    -   Point out and explain basic list operations blocks
        -   The "item," "add," and "delete" blocks will be most important.  The "length" block will be useful as well.
        -   Point out that these blocks all take a list as an argument.
-   Activity
    -   Students should complete the "You Talkin' to Me?" activity individually or in pairs
        -   Encourage students to be creative with their word lists
        -   Don't allow students to fixate on the exact grammatical correctness of generated phrases and sentences
            -   If this is a major concern, choose words for the lists such that generated phrases will always be grammatically correct
-   Debrief
    -   Ask a student to present and discuss their solution to each step
        -   Emphasizes uses of lists and encourage students to discuss and think about why lists were necessary
        -   Ask students to consider if the tasks would have been doable without lists

## Accommodations/Differentiation

-   In addition to the bonuses in the lab, advanced students can attempt further extensions of the grammar, including conjunctions, non-transitive verb phrases, and/or recursive rules (e.g. multiple adjectives).  
    -   A more complex context-free grammar for English sentences can be found here: <http://www.cs.uccs.edu/~jkalita/work/cs589/2013/12Grammars.pdf>.  
-   Struggling students should focus on generating a noun phrase from only a few words.  The other parts of speech and phrase types can be omitted without losing the key learning objectives.
-   Non-native English speakers or those with low literacy may struggle with the grammatical concepts here.  Since the grammar is not the key objective, feel free to scaffold liberally and/or substitute a different type of grammar.
    -   Other grammar examples, including arithmetic expressions (which are a good simple substitute) can be found here: <https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~nelson/courses/csc_173/grammars/cfg.html>.
