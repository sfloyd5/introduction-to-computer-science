# Project 1: Animated Storytelling

Students will select a friend, classmate, teacher or relative who will serve as the end-user for this project. Students will create an animated story for this individual using SNAP commands and sprites. They will interview the individual, determine their likes/dislikes, interests and favourite books and movies and based on this information, will create their animated story. Students will proceed through the Applied Design stages, logging information as they go, and will submit this log with their animated story.

## Overview

Storytelling is a great way to convey culture.  Some examples of storytelling are plays and nursery rhymes. Famous plays like those of William Shakespeare have been performed over centuries.  Some have been adapted for modern times like West Side Story. A nursery rhyme is a short poem or song written for children. Though the term is typically applied to British or other English language poems, similar concepts exist in many world cultures. These short stories are generally meant to entertain and/or calm young children. Some are believed to have a hidden moral or meaning related to historical events, but many of these meanings are questionable.

## Details

###Behavior
You will select and interview a friend, classmate, teacher or relative (who will serve as your end-user) and then you will create an animated story for this individual. It is up to you to decide on the story plot, themes and characters. However, these things should reflect the responses from interviewing your end-user.

As you interview your end-user, create the animated story using SNAP, and then test and share the program, you will proceed through the Applied Design stages. This document will lead you through the follownig stages (you should submit this to your teacher when complete):<br>
<br><b>Understanding Context - Defining - Ideating - Prototyping - Testing - Sharing</b><br>

-   Whenever the green flag is clicked, your SNAP animation should display your chosen story line by line somewhere on the stage. (This should work correctly even if the last run was interrupted and restart.)
-   As each line is shown, sprites should act out the story.
-   The animation should advance on its own, but should do so at a pace that allows each action to complete and the viewer to read the line before the next line is shown and new action begins.
-   In addition, the sprites must act out the rhyme or story; you should not simply create a series of static backgrounds or costumes that show a stop-motion version of the story.
-   Each line must be readable and must stay shown while the corresponding action is occurring.
-   When the story ends, there should be a way for the user to replay the entire animation from the beginning.
-   You are free to be as creative as you like with your choice of sprites and actions.<br />
    <br />
    You may choose from the sprites provided by SNAP or create your own. (You will not be graded on your artistic skills.) You may interpret the story literally or be clever with your depiction (but don't go too far). However, all sprites, behaviors, words, and animations must be school-appropriate.<br />
    <br />
    If you choose a particularly long story, you may not need to animate the whole thing.

###Implementation Details
As mentioned above, your animation must display the text and animate each line. Action must be performed by sprites and must consist of more than simply changing costumes. You must include the following components in your animation:

-   At least two sprites that act in some way to contribute to the depiction of the story
-   At least one sprite that moves
-   At least one sprite that rotates
-   At least one sprite that changes costume
-   At least one sprite that is both hidden and shown at some point

Note that multiple of these requirements may be satisfied by the same sprite (e.g. the same sprite can both move and change costume), but you must have at least two separate sprites that act in the animation.
